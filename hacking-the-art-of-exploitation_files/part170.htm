This means that it is theoretically possible for an eaves- dropper to break the encryption, but it is practically infeasible to actually do so, since the amount of time and resources necessary would far exceed the value of the encrypted information. Usually, the time needed to break a computationally secure cryptosystem is measured in tens of thousands of years, even with the assumption of a vast array of computational resources. Most modern cryptosystems fall into this category.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 106%;text-align: left;">It’s important to note that the best-known algorithms for breaking crypto- systems are always evolving and being improved. Ideally, a cryptosystem would be defined as computationally secure if the <span class="s27">best </span>algorithm for breaking it requires an unreasonable amount of computational resources and time, but there is currently no way to prove that a given encryption-breaking algo- rithm is and always will be the best one. So, the <span class="s27">current </span>best-known algorithm is used instead to measure a cryptosystem’s security.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part171.htm">0x720 Algorithmic Run Time</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part169.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part171.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
