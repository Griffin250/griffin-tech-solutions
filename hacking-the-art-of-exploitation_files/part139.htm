However, when testing, this is something that is easily overlooked. If log files seem like the most obvious sign of intrusion to you, then you are forgetting about the loss of service.

In a real-world scenario, this exploit would be detected almost immediately when someone tries to access the website.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">A skilled hacker can not only crack open a program to exploit it, he can also put the program back together again and keep it running.
