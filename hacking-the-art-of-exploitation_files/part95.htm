Teardrop exploited another weakness in several vendors’ implemen- tations of IP fragmentation reassembly. Usually, when a packet is fragmented, the offsets stored in the header will line up to reconstruct the original packet with no overlap. The teardrop attack sent packet fragments with overlapping offsets, which caused implementations that didn’t check for this irregular condition to inevitably crash.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Although this specific attack doesn’t work anymore, understanding the concept can reveal problems in other areas. Although not limited to a Denial of Service, a recent remote exploit in the OpenBSD kernel (which prides itself on security) had to do with fragmented IPv6 packets. IP version 6 uses more complicated headers and even a different IP address format than the IPv4 most people are familiar with. Often, the same mistakes made in the past are repeated by early implementations of new products.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part94.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part96.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
