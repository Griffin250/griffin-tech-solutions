Historically, cryptology has been of particular interest during wars, when countries used secret codes to communicate with their troops while also trying to break the enemy’s codes to infiltrate their communications.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">The wartime applications still exist, but the use of cryptography in civilian life is becoming increasingly popular as more critical transactions occur over the Internet. Network sniffing is so common that the paranoid assumption that someone is always sniffing network traffic might not be so paranoid. Passwords, credit card numbers, and other proprietary information can all be sniffed and stolen over unencrypted protocols. Encrypted com- munication protocols provide a solution to this lack of privacy and allow the Internet economy to function. Without Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">encryption, credit card transactions at popular websites would be either very inconvenient or insecure.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">All of this private data is protected by cryptographic algorithms that are probably secure. Currently, cryptosystems that can be proven to be secure are far too unwieldy for practical use. So in lieu of a mathematical proof of security, cryptosystems that are <span class="s27">practically secure </span>are used. This means that it’s possible that shortcuts for defeating these ciphers exist, but no one’s been able to actualize them yet. Of course, there are also cryptosystems that aren’t secure at all. This could be due to the implementation, key size, or simply cryptanalytic weaknesses in the cipher itself. In 1997, under US law, the maximum allowable key size for encryption in exported software was 40 bits. This limit on key size makes the corresponding cipher insecure, as was shown by RSA Data Security and Ian Goldberg, a graduate student from the Uni- versity of California, Berkeley. RSA posted a challenge to decipher a message encrypted with a 40-bit key, and three and a half hours later, Ian had done just that. This was strong evidence that 40-bit keys aren’t large enough for a secure cryptosystem.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Cryptology is relevant to hacking in a number of ways. At the purest level, the challenge of solving a puzzle is enticing to the curious. At a more nefarious level, the secret data protected by that puzzle is perhaps even more alluring. Breaking or circumventing the cryptographic protections of secret data can provide a certain sense of satisfaction, not to mention a sense of the protected data’s contents. In addition, strong cryptography is useful in avoiding detection. Expensive network intrusion detection systems designed to sniff network traffic for attack signatures are useless if the attacker is using an encrypted communication channel. Often, the encrypted Web access provided for customer security is used by attackers as a difficult-to-monitor attack vector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part166.htm">0x710 Information Theory</a><a class="toc0" href="part167.htm">0x711 Unconditional Security</a><a class="toc0" href="part168.htm">0x712 One-Time Pads</a><a class="toc0" href="part169.htm">0x713 Quantum Key Distribution</a><a class="toc0" href="part170.htm">0x714 Computational Security</a><a class="toc1" href="part171.htm">0x720 Algorithmic Run Time</a><a class="toc0" href="part172.htm">0x721 Asymptotic Notation</a><a class="toc1" href="part173.htm">0x730 Symmetric Encryption</a><a class="toc0" href="part174.htm">0x731 Lov Grover’s Quantum Search Algorithm</a><a class="toc1" href="part175.htm">0x740 Asymmetric Encryption</a><a class="toc0" href="part176.htm">0x741 RSA</a><a class="toc0" href="part177.htm">0x742 Peter Shor’s Quantum Factoring Algorithm</a><a class="toc1" href="part178.htm">0x750 Hybrid Ciphers</a><a class="toc0" href="part179.htm">0x751 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</a><a class="toc0" href="part180.htm">0x752 Differing SSH Protocol Host Fingerprints</a><a class="toc0" href="part181.htm">0x753 Fuzzy Fingerprints</a><a class="toc1" href="part182.htm">0x760 Password Cracking</a><a class="toc0" href="part183.htm">0x761 Dictionary Attacks</a><a class="toc0" href="part184.htm">0x762 Exhaustive Brute-Force Attacks</a><a class="toc0" href="part185.htm">0x763 Hash Lookup Table</a><a class="toc0" href="part186.htm">0x764 Password Probability Matrix</a><a class="toc1" href="part187.htm">0x770 Wireless 802.11b Encryption</a><a class="toc0" href="part188.htm">0x771 Wired Equivalent Privacy</a><a class="toc0" href="part189.htm">0x772 RC4 Stream Cipher</a><a class="toc1" href="part190.htm">0x780 WEP Attacks</a><a class="toc0" href="part191.htm">0x781 Offline Brute-Force Attacks</a><a class="toc0" href="part192.htm">0x782 Keystream Reuse</a><a class="toc0" href="part193.htm">0x783  IV-Based Decryption Dictionary Tables</a><a class="toc0" href="part194.htm">0x784 IP Redirection</a><a class="toc0" href="part195.htm">0x785  Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir Attack</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part164.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part166.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
