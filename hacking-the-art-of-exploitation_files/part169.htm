One of these is a practical implementation of the one- time pad, made possible by quantum key distribution. The mystery of quantum entanglement can provide a reliable and secret method of sending a random string of bits that can be used as a key. This is done using nonorthogonal quantum states in photons.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">Without going into too much detail, the polarization of a photon is the oscillation direction of its electric field, which in this case can be along the horizontal, vertical, or one of the two diagonals. <span class="s27">Nonorthogonal </span>simply means the states are separated by an angle that isn’t 90 degrees. Curiously enough, it’s impossible to determine with certainty which of these four polarizations a single photon has. The rectilinear basis of the horizontal and vertical polariza- tions is incompatible with the diagonal basis of the two diagonal polarizations, so, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, these two sets of polarizations cannot both be measured. Filters can be used to measure the polarizations— one for the rectilinear basis and one for the diagonal basis. When a photon passes through the correct filter, its polarization won’t change, but if it passes</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">through the incorrect filter, its polarization will be randomly modified. This means that any eavesdropping attempt to measure the polarization of a photon has a good chance of scrambling the data, making it apparent that the channel isn’t secure.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">These strange aspects of quantum mechanics were put to good use by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in the first and probably best-known quantum key distribution scheme, called <span class="s27">BB84</span>. First, the sender and receiver agree on bit representation for the four polarizations, such that each basis has both 1 and 0. In this scheme, 1 could be represented by both vertical photon polarization and one of the diagonal polarizations (positive</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">45 degrees), while 0 could be represented by horizontal polarization and the other diagonal polarization (negative 45 degrees). This way, 1s and 0s can exist when the rectilinear polarization is measured and when the diagonal polarization is measured.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Then, the sender sends a stream of random photons, each coming from a randomly chosen basis (either rectilinear or diagonal), and these photons are recorded. When the receiver receives a photon, he also randomly chooses to measure it in either the rectilinear basis or the diagonal basis and records the result. Now, the two parties publicly compare which basis they used for each photon, and they keep only the data corresponding to the photons they both measured using the same basis. This doesn’t reveal the bit values of the photons, since there are both 1s and 0s in each basis. This makes up the key for the one-time pad.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Since an eavesdropper would ultimately end up changing the polarization of some of these photons and thus scramble the data, eavesdropping can be detected by computing the error rate of some random subset of the key. If there are too many errors, someone was probably eavesdropping, and the key should be thrown away. If not, the transmission of the key data was secure and private.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part168.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part170.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
