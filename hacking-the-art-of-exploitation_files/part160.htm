The state of computer security is a constantly changing landscape, and specific vulnerabilities are discovered and patched every day. However, if you understand the concepts of the core hacking techniques explained in this book, you can apply them in new and inventive ways to solve the problem du jour. Like LEGO bricks, these techniques can be used in millions of different combinations and configurations. As with any art, the more you practice these techniques, the better you’ll understand them. With this understanding comes the wisdom to guesstimate offsets and recognize memory segments by their address ranges.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">In this case, the problem is still ASLR. Hopefully, you have a few bypass ideas you might want to try out now. Don’t be afraid to use the debugger to examine what is actually happening. There are probably several ways to bypass ASLR, and you may invent a new technique. If you don’t find a solution, don’t worry—I’ll explain a method in the next section. But it’s worthwhile to think about this problem a little on your own before reading ahead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part159.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part161.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
