The data portion of ICMP packets is commonly overlooked, since the important information is in the header. Several operating systems crashed if they were sent ICMP echo messages that exceeded the size specified. An ICMP echo message of this gar- gantuan size became affectionately known as “The Ping of Death.” It was a very simple hack exploiting a vulnerability that existed because no one ever considered this possibility. It should be easy for you to write a program using libnet that can perform this attack; however, it won’t be that useful in the real world. Modern systems are all patched against this vulnerability.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">However, history tends to repeat itself. Even though oversized ICMP packets won’t crash computers anymore, new technologies sometimes suffer from similar problems. The Bluetooth protocol, commonly used with phones, has a similar ping packet on the L2CAP layer, which is also used to measure the communication time on established links. Many implementations of Bluetooth suffer from the same oversized ping packet problem. Adam Laurie, Marcel Holtmann, and Martin Herfurt have dubbed this attack <span class="s27">Bluesmack </span>and have released source code by the same name that performs this attack.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part93.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part95.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
