Since bandwidth consumption is the goal of a flooding DoS attack, the more bandwidth the attacker is able to work with, the more damage they can do. In a DDoS attack, the attacker first compromises a number of other hosts and installs daemons on them. Systems installed with such software are commonly referred to as bots and make up what is known as a botnet. These bots wait patiently until the attacker picks a victim and decides to attack. The attacker uses some sort of a controlling program, and all of the bots simulta- neously attack the victim with some form of flooding DoS attack. Not only does the great number of distributed hosts multiply the effect of the flood- ing, this also makes tracing the attack source much more difficult.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part99.htm">0x460 TCP/IP Hijacking</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part97.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../hacking-the-art-of-exploitation.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part99.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
