  <h1> DATA STRUCTURES AND IP ADDRESS</h1>
  <p class="review-date"> Last update: Dec 10, 2023 by  Griffin</p>
  <img src="Images/ipaddress.jpg">
  <p>An <span>IP Address</span> represents an Internet Protocol address. 
    A unique address that identifies the device over the network. It is almost like a set of rules governing the structure of data sent over the Internet or through a local network.<br>
     An IP address helps the Internet to distinguish between different routers, computers, and websites. 
    It serves as a specific machine identifier in a specific network and helps to improve visual communication between source and destination.</p>
    
    <p><span>IP address structure: </span>  IP addresses are displayed as a set of four digits- the default address may be 192.158.1.38. 
    Each number on the set may range from 0 to 255. Therefore, the total IP address range ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.</p>
    
        <iframe class="medium-ad-frame" src="Website-ad.html"> </iframe>

<div class="port-list">
  <p>IP address is basically divided into two parts: X1. X2. X3. X4 <br>
    1. [X1. X2. X3] is the Network ID<br>
    2. [X4] is the Host ID</p>
</div>
<h2>1. Network ID</h2>
<p>It is the part of the left-hand IP address that identifies the specific network where the device is located. 
In the normal home network, where the device has an IP address 192.168.1.32, the 192.168.1 part of the address will be the network ID.<br>
 It is customary to fill in the last part that is not zero, so we can say that the device’s network ID is 192.168.1.0.</p>

<h2>2. Hosting ID</h2>
 <p> The host ID is part of the IP address that was not taken by the network ID.
 Identifies a specific device (in the TCP / IP world, we call devices “host”) in that network.<br>
 Continuing with our example of the IP address 192.168.1.32, the host ID will be 32- the unique host ID on the 192.168.1.0 network.</p>
 <h2>Versions of IP Address: </h2>
  <h3>1. <a href="##" class="link"> IPV4 </a>  (Internet Protocol Version 4)</h3> 
    <p> It is the first version of Internet Protocol address. 
    The address size of IPV4 is 32 bit number. In this Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) with respect to network security is optional. 
    It is having 4,294,967,296 number of address still we are seeing a shortage in network addresses as the use of network & virtual devices are increasing rapidly.</p>

    <h2>What is IPV4?</h2>
    <hr class="breaklines">
<p>IP stands for Internet Protocol and v4 stands for Version Four (IPv4). 
IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the ARPANET in 1983. <br>
  IP version four addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation. 
  Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address. </p>
<h2>Parts of IPV4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span>Network parts:</span>The network part indicates the distinctive variety that’s appointed to the network. 
    The network part conjointly identifies the category of the network that’s assigned.
  </li>
  <li> <span> Host part:</span>The host part uniquely identifies the machine on your network. 
    This part of the IPv4 address is assigned to every host. 
    For each host on the network, the network part is the same, however, the host half must vary.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>  <span> Subnet number:</span>This is the nonobligatory part of IPv4. 
    Local networks that have massive numbers of hosts are divided into subnets and subnet numbers are appointed to that. </li>
</ul>
<iframe src="Blocked-ad.html" class="small-ad-frame"></iframe>
<h2>Characteristics of IPV4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IPv4 could be a 32-Bit IP Address.</li>
  <li> The number of header fields is twelve and the length of the header field is twenty.</li>
  <li> It has Unicast, broadcast, and multicast style of addresses.</li>
  <li> IPv4 supports VLSM (Virtual Length Subnet Mask).</li>
  <li> IPv4 uses the Post Address Resolution Protocol to map to the MAC address.</li>
  <li>  RIP may be a routing protocol supported by the routed daemon.</li>
  <li>Networks ought to be designed either manually or with DHCP.</li>
  <li>Packet fragmentation permits from routers and causing host.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages of IPV4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IPv4 security permits encryption to keep up privacy and security.</li>
  <li>IPV4 network allocation is significant and presently has quite 85000 practical routers.</li>
  <li>It becomes easy to attach multiple devices across an outsized network while not NAT.</li>
  <li> This is a model of communication so provides quality service also as economical knowledge transfer.</li>
  <li>IPV4 addresses are redefined and permit flawless encoding.</li>
  <li>Routing is a lot of scalable and economical as a result of addressing is collective more effectively.</li>
  <li>Data communication across the network becomes a lot of specific in multicast organizations</li>
  <li>Limits net growth for existing users and hinders the use of the net for brand new users.</li>
  <li>Internet Routing is inefficient in IPv4.</li>
  <li>IPv4 has high System Management prices and it’s labor-intensive, complex, slow & frequent to errors.</li>
  <li>Security features are nonobligatory.</li>
  <li>Difficult to feature support for future desires as a result of adding it on is extremely high overhead since 
  it hinders the flexibility to attach everything over IP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations of IPV4</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IP relies on network layer addresses to identify end-points on network, and each network has a unique IP address.</li>
  <li>The world’s supply of unique IP addresses is dwindling, and they might eventually run out theoretically.</li>
  <li>If there are multiple host, we need IP addresses of next class.</li>
  <li>Complex host and routing configuration, non-hierarchical addressing, difficult to re-numbering addresses,
     large routing tables, non-trivial implementations in providing security, QoS (Quality of Service), mobility and multi-homing, multicasting etc...
     are the big limitation of IPv4 so that’s why IPv6 came into the picture.</li>

   <h3> 2.<a href="##" class="link"> IPV6</a> (Internet Protocol Version 6):</h3>
    <p>  It is the recent version of Internet Protocol address. 
      The address size of IPV6 is 128 bit number. In this Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) with respect to network security is mandatory. 
      It allows 3.4 x 10^38 unique IP addresses which seems to be more than sufficient to support trillions of internet devices present now or coming in future.</p>
      
 <button class="readmore-less-btn" onclick="openIPV6()">Read more about IPV6...</button>

 <div class="more-content2" id="MoreContent2">
  <h2>What is IPV6?</h2>
  <hr class="breaklines">
  <img src="Images/IPV6.png">
  <p>IP address is your digital identity. It’s a network address for your computer so the Internet knows where to send you emails, data, etc.</p>
 <div class="port-list">
  <i>IP address determines who and where you are in the network of billions of digital devices that are connected to the Internet.</i>
 </div>
 <p>IPv6 or Internet Protocol Version 6 is a network layer protocol that allows communication to take place over the network. 
IPv6 was designed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in December 1998 with the purpose of superseding the IPv4 due to the global exponentially growing internet users.</p>

 <h2>Types of IPV6</h2> Now that we know about what is IPv6 address let’s take a look at its different types.
 <ul>
  <li><span>Unicast addresses:</span> It identifies a unique node on a network and usually refers to a single sender or a single receiver.</li>
  <li><span>Multicast addresses:</span> It represents a group of IP devices and can only be used as the destination of a datagram.</li>
  <li><span>Anycast addresses:</span> It is assigned to a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Advantages of IPV6</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Reliability.</li>
  <li><span>Faster speeds:</span> IPv6 supports multicast rather than broadcast in IPv4.
  This feature allows bandwidth-intensive packet flows (like multimedia streams) to be sent to multiple destinations all at once.</li>
  <li><span>Stronger Security:</span>  IPSecurity, which provides confidentiality, and data integrity, is embedded into IPv6.</li>
  <li>Routing efficiency.</li>
  <li><span>Most importantly it’s the final solution for growing nodes in Global-network.</span></li>

 </ul>
 <h2>Disadvantages of IPV6</h2>
 <ul>
  <li> <span>Conversion:</span> Due to widespread present usage of IPv4 it will take a long period to completely shift to IPv6.</li>
  <li> <span>Communication:</span>IPv4 and IPv6 machines cannot communicate directly with each other. <br>
  They need an intermediate technology to make that possible.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>IPV4 vs IPV6</h2>
<img src="Images/IPv4-vs-IPv6.png">
<p>The common type of IP address (is known as IPv4, for “version 4”). Here’s an example of what an IP address might look like:</p>
<div class="port-list"> <p>25.59.209.224</p></div>
<p>An IPv4 address consists of four numbers, each of which contains one to three digits, with a single dot (.) separating each number or set of digits. 
Each of the four numbers can range from 0 to 255. This group of separated numbers creates the addresses that let you and everyone around the globe to send and retrieve data over our Internet connections.<br> 
The IPv4 uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. To date, it is considered the primary Internet Protocol and carries 94% of Internet traffic.
 Initially, it was assumed it would never run out of addresses but the present situation paves a new way to IPv6, let’s see why? An IPv6 address consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits. <br>
Here’s an example IPv6 address:</p>
<div class="port-list"><p>3001:0da8:75a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</p></div>
<p>This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfil the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4.
 With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address space. IPv6 also called IPng (Internet Protocol next generation).</p>
 <div class="port-list">
  <i>IPv6 support a theoretical maximum of 340, 282, 366, 920, 938, 463, 463, 374, 607, 431, 768, 211, 456. <br>
    To keep it straightforward, we will never run out of IP addresses again.</i>
 </div>

<h2>IP Address types</h2>
<p>There are 4 types of IP Addresses- Public, Private, Fixed, and Dynamic.
 Among them, public and private addresses are derived from their local network location, which should be used within the network while public IP is used offline.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <h3> Public IP address– </h3>
<p>A public IP address is an Internet Protocol address, encrypted by various servers/devices.
 That’s when you connect these devices with your internet connection. <br>
This is the same IP address we show on our homepage. So why the second page? Well, not all people speak the IP language. 
We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to get the information they need. Some even call this their external IP address.
 A public Internet Protocol address is an Internet Protocol address accessed over the Internet. <br>
 Like the postal address used to deliver mail to your home, the public Internet Protocol address is a different international Internet Protocol address assigned to a computer device.
  The web server, email server, and any server device that has direct access to the Internet are those who will enter the public Internet Protocol address. 
Internet Address Protocol is unique worldwide and is only supplied with a unique device.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <h3>Private IP address–</h3>
  <p>Everything that connects to your Internet network has a private IP address. This includes computers, smartphones, 
  and tablets but also any Bluetooth-enabled devices such as speakers, printers, or smart TVs.<br>
 With the growing internet of things, the number of private IP addresses you have at home is likely to increase. 
 Your router needs a way to identify these things separately, and most things need a way to get to know each other.<br>
   Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that separates the network.</p></li>
  <li> <h3> Static IP address–</h3> 
  <p>A static IP address is an invalid IP address. Conversely, a dynamic IP address will be provided by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server,
     which can change. <br> The Static IP address does not change but can be changed as part of normal network management.</p>
     <p>Static IP addresses are incompatible, given once, remain the same over the years. This type of IP also helps you get more information about the device.</p>
  </li>
<li> <h3> Dynamic IP address– </h3> 
<p>It means constant change. A dynamic IP address changes from time to time and is not always the same.
 If you have a live cable or DSL service, you may have a strong IP address. Internet Service Providers provide customers with dynamic IP addresses because they are too expensive. <br>
Instead of one permanent IP address, your IP address is taken out of the address pool and assigned to you. After a few days, weeks, or sometimes even months, that number is returned to the lake and given a new number. <br>
Most ISPs will not provide a static IP address to customers who live there and when they do, they are usually more expensive.
 Dynamic IP addresses are annoying, but with the right software, you can navigate easily and for free. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Types of Website IP Address</h2>
<p>Website IP address is of two types- Dedicated IP Address and Shared IP Address. Let us discuss the two.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <h3>Dedicated IP address– </h3> 
  <p>A dedicated IP address is one that is unique for each website. This address is not used by any other domain.
   A dedicated IP address is beneficial in many ways. It provides increased speed when the traffic load is high and brings in increased security.
   But dedicated IPs are costly as compared to shared IPs. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <h3>Shared IP address– </h3> 
  <p>A shared IP address is one that is not unique.
   It is shared between multiple domains. A shared IP address is enough for most users because common configurations don’t require a dedicated IP. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
  <h2>IP Address Classification Based on Operational Characteristics:</h2>
  <p>According to operational characteristics, IP address is classified as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Broadcast Addressing–</h3> 
  <p>The term ‘Broadcast’ means to transmit audio or video over a network. A broadcast packet is sent to all users of a local network at once.<br>
     They do not have to be explicitly named as recipients. The users of a network can open the data packets and then interpret the information, carry out the instructions or discard it.
   This service is available in IPv4. The IP address commonly used for broadcasting is 255.255.255.255</p>
  </li>
  <iframe class="medium-ad-frame" src="Youtube.html"></iframe>
  <li> <h3>Unicast Addressing–</h3> 
  <p>This address identifies a unique node on the network. Unicast is nothing but one-to-one data transmission from one point in the network to another. 
    It is the most common form of IP addressing. This method can be used for both sending and receiving data. It is available in IPv4 and IPv6. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Multicast Addresses–</h3>
  <p>These IP addresses mainly help to establish one-to-many communication. Multicast IP routing protocols are used to distribute data to multiple recipients. 
  The class D addresses (224.0.0.0  to  239.255.255.255) define the multicast group.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Anycast Addressing–</h3>
  <p>In anycast addressing the data, a packet is not transmitted to all the receivers on the network. 
  When a data packet is allocated to an anycast address, it is delivered to the closest interface that has this anycast address. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
